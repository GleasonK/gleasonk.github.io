	<div>
		<b>Required Parts</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Notification Icons - about (25px X 25px), will have text next to them.</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Fifty Yes icon</li>
					<li>Fifty No icon</li>
					<li>View in fifty icon</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Phone App icons - Sizes differ</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Main 5|O icon</li>
					<li>View notifications icon (currently square with # of icons. Can keep that but pick colors)</li>
					<li>View results icon (same deal as notifications)</li>
					<li>Send 5|O button</li>
					<li>Buddy list group icon ideas (Maybe just circle with first letter of group name in it to be simple.  (R) for roommates etc.)</li>
					<li>Actually I like the idea of having a circular/square logo with the first letter of a username/group in it. Say you have a new 5|O from GleasonK, you could put the (G) logo next to it. Not everywhere but that would be a good thing to have. Design that one as a concept with a font letter, wont need 26 png images, can make it with the android equivalent of div's and CSS</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<b>Design Requirements for Mobile</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Home screen</b> - keep it simple.</li>
			<li><b>Login Screen</b> - Not terribly important, only should be seen once</li>
			<li><b>Navigation</b> - Way to navigate from home to notifications. Dream here, can be a swipe-slide like snapchat or a button that sends you to notification screen.</li>
			<li><b>Notification</b> - Way to show notification count on home screen. Currently done with square and number. Keep it geometric, can be a custom notification icon with and a small circle pops up with a number in it like iPhone.</li>
			<li><b>Results</b> - Currently in the home screen, the blue square is for results the red is notifications. The sample results screen should only hold names of people who said yes or no, list can be scrollable or in columns.</li>
			<li><b>Buddy List</b> - How easiest way to select friends. All option to lead to friend list, but focus on groupings for ease.</li>
			<li><b>Send Settings</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Simple settings for sending like [ ]Anonymous etc.</li>
					<li>Option for time out so you arent waiting for days to receive response</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>View Results</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Need a way to view results with one of (yes | I | 1) on the right and (no | O | 0) on the left, looking natural.</li> 
					<li>See third image. I'm into that as a concept but very open to better ideas.</li> 
					<li>It hints that the top selection was the (left | yes | I) option for the sake of yes/no questions as well as two option questions.</li>
					<li>Currently that view shows the questions asked because I dont have usernames. But normally that view would only apply to one question and the text would be usernames who replied either way.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<b>Design Requirements for Watch</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Main screen</b> 
				<ul>
					<li>keep it simple. I have a simple three split mock up.</li> 
					<li>All we really need is a way to get to: 1. Ask a question 2. View questions asked 3. View results of questions</li>
					<li>Better Idea. I actually kinda dig that of the watch interface looking like letters. So the Q speech bubble for questions. The a can be much better for Ask and how about the three dash menu be shaped like an R for results. That could be cool.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
